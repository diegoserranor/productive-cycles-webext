# Productive Cycles
Pomodoro-inspired timer extension for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/productive-cycles/) and [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/productive-cycles/lhcaggipefcoefbijhmdehhloonnlobh)

This [article](https://blog.trello.com/how-to-pomodoro-your-way-to-productivity) from the Trello blog explains it nicely

### Features
- Timer with configurable minutes
- Configurable cycles - number of periods the user wants the timer to repeat itself for
- Tracker for completed cycles during each session
- Notifications sent to the user once the timer expires

### Inspiration
- A hands-on project to practice Javascript, and to learn more about listeners + asynchronous programming
- Automating a technique that has worked really well for me
- Chrome extension vs. mobile app: quicker deployment
- This became an opportunity to publish a piece of software in a store for the first time
